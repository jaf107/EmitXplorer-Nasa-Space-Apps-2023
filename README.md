## Introduction

Emit Explorer is a web application developed to address the critical issue of greenhouse gas concentration levels and environmental awareness. We have designed this application to cater to users of all age groups, providing an interactive platform for learning about social responsibilities and environmental risk factors through gamified actions. Emit Explorer empowers users to visualize, understand, and contribute to a cleaner, healthier world.

## Key Features

### Geospatial Gas Level Prediction

Emit Explorer offers users the ability to input specific date, latitude, and longitude values to obtain predictions for greenhouse gas levels, including CO2, O3, O2, and SO2 at their chosen location on the given date.

### Interactive Map Interface

Our application provides an interactive map interface that allows users to select their desired location by clicking on the map or entering latitude and longitude coordinates. This feature enhances user engagement and makes it easy to explore pollution data globally.

### Real-time, Historical, Prediction Data

Once a location is selected, Emit Explorer provides users with access to real-time and historical data on CO2, O3, and methane concentration levels. Users can choose to view the raw data or a simplified version that includes danger level indicators.

### Danger Level Prediction

Emit Explorer utilizes historical and prediction data to estimate the danger level of pollution at a selected location. This estimation includes a time limit prediction, helping users understand the potential environmental risks they may face.

### Tree-pedia

Emit Explorer includes a "Tree-pedia" section that offers interactive information about various trees and their significance in environmental restoration. Users can access essential details about trees that thrive in their selected region.

### Social Media Integration

Our application encourages active contributions to the environment by providing a social media-like blog post section. Users can post and share their environmental efforts and engage with a community of like-minded individuals. A leaderboard ranks users based on their environmental contributions.

### Awareness About the EMIT Project

Emit Explorer dedicated a page to provide users with the latest updates about NASA's EMIT project. This feature offers insights into the project's goals, progress, and potential applications of the data collected by EMIT.
